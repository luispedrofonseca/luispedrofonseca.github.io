Hi all, long time no talk.

For the past few months I've been incredibly busy between client work andÂ working on my first Unity plugin.Â This plugin started out as a little tool that I extracted from Project Cuba, but ended up becoming a full-fledged 2D camera solution so I decided to turn it into a plugin and put it on the Asset Store.

It ended up taking up a lot more time than I expected due to all the work I wasn't anticipating, mostly marketing related. I tracked everything down so maybe soon I'll write a blog post about it.

In the meantime,Â go check it out and let me know your thoughts! ðŸ˜‰
