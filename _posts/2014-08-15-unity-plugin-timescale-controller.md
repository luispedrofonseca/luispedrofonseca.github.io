One of the key aspects of the game I'm [currently working on](/project-cuba "Project Cuba") is trying to makeÂ all the animations blend nicely together.Â That blending is accomplished by the fantastic Spine which I vouched for in a [previous blog post](/unity-2d-skeletal-animation/).

However, Spine does not (yet) have a way for you to test how animations transition to each other meaning I have to rely on how it looks during gameplay. Since my game is quiteÂ fast-paced,Â most transitions are fractions of a second which makes it really hard to see if they're blending perfectly or not.

This is where a simple, but incredibly useful,Â Unity plugin made by the talented friend <a href="https://twitter.com/HRuivo89" target="_blank">Hugo Ruivo</a>Â comes into place. Behold the life-saver <a href="http://hruivoportfolio.wordpress.com/2014/07/26/time-scale-controller-unity3d-editor-extension/" target="_blank">TimeScale Controller</a>!

It does one thing only, but does it beautifully. It allows you to control the time scale during gameplay and see how everything looks likeÂ in slow-motion (or fast forward, if you'd like). It may sound simplistic and I'm sure most of you couldÂ do your own, but why reinvent the wheelÂ especially when the wheel you got is completely FREE! ðŸ˜‰

Hope this plugin is useful for you and don't forget to <a href="https://twitter.com/HRuivo89" target="_blank">thank Hugo</a>!
