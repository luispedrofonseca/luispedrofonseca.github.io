Recently I was digging through some of my files and found the various iterations of Jack, the main character of my upcoming game, Project Cuba.

While the process itselfÂ wasÂ fairly simple and quick I think it's worth to share because it showsÂ a different approach of the typical process. Since myÂ hand drawing skills are kinda limited I opted to jumpÂ straight into Illustrator. While this is probably a lot slower for someone that knows how to put their thoughts in paper and only then trace them. For me, it allows to slowly progress into what I have in my headÂ andÂ at the same time it gives me flexibility to make bold changes and not worrying about ruining it. In fact, most of the time is by doing bold changes (or mistakes) that you end up finding that cool detail you were not initially planning.

That said, here's the final result. Hope you like and let me know your thoughts! ðŸ˜‰
