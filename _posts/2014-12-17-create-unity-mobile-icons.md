If you work with UnityÂ for mobile you know the pain of creating all the required icon sizes. That's why I created a service for OS X (sorry Windows users), that with a simple right-click onÂ a PNG gives you the option to create and conveniently name them.

![](/static/images/create-unity-mobile-icons/unity_create_mobile_icons.png)

Just select a largeÂ PNG of your icon, right-click, and then under _Services_Â you'll find _Create Unity Mobile Icons_.

To install, downloadÂ [this zip file](/static/zip/Create-Unity-Mobile-Icons.zip)Â and double-click the workflow file inside.

Let me know how this worked for you! ðŸ˜‰ If you liked this, please share with the links below and [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com) for more Unity tips and tricks (and a few other random bits and pieces).
