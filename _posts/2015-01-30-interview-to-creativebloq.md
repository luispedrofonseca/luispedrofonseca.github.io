The nice guys at <a href="http://www.creativebloq.com" target="_blank">CreativeBloq</a> contacted me to do an interview regarding my creative process, more specifically about how I used Affinity Designer on Project Cuba to speed up my development.

Take a look <a href="http://www.creativebloq.com/how-design-game-character" target="_blank">here</a> and let me know your thoughts! ðŸ˜‰
