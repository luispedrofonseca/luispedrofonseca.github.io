One of the coolest features for <a href="http://esotericsoftware.com" target="_blank">Spine</a> is finally ready for prime-time. The inverse kinematics (IK) has been in the works for a few months already but it's now available in the editor and on a wide range of the <a href="https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes" target="_blank">supported runtimes</a>.

For now, I've only been doing some quick tests but I already have a few ideas on how I can put this to good use on Project Cuba. Stay tuned and <a href="https://twitter.com/lpfonseca" target="_blank">follow me on Twitter</a> for more on Project Cuba coming soon!
