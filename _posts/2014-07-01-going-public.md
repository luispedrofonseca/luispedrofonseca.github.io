For the last several months, during my (very limited) free time, I've been working Â on a game which started toÂ form in my head ever since I visited the incredibly beautiful city ofÂ Havana, CubaÂ inÂ October 2012.

I got enchanted by everything about it but especially its oldÂ charmÂ -Â from the colourful 19th-century buildings to the imported american cars, the incredibleÂ white sandÂ beachesÂ and the overall good vibe of the cuban locals.

At that point I was already prototypingÂ a top-down stealth game, andÂ I then knew it had to be about Cuba. Given the stealth mechanics of myÂ prototype I wantedÂ to come up withÂ a spy/conspiracy story that fitted right into the cuban theme and its whole retro atmosphere.

Between me and my girlfriend (thank you!) we came upÂ withÂ various crazy concepts but in the end weÂ settledÂ for a fictional story around the relatively famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_missile_crisis" target="_blank">Cuban missile crisis</a>.Â To add a bit of humour into the mix we came upÂ with aÂ retired american copÂ taken right out of a Miami Vice episode. I uninspiredlyÂ called the game Project Cuba - and hereÂ areÂ the main characters (more about them in an upcoming post):

Throughout 2013 I worked on this stealth prototype on and off (mostly off) and unfortunately only around Christmas I decided that it didn't have what it needed to be a fun game and finally dropped it. However, I couldn't just loose all the work I'd done so I decided to reuseÂ the story, the characters and even some of the previous mechanics on my next project. I started working a new prototype on January 1st 2014Â andÂ after spending most of Christmas vacations playing Rayman Legends on my iPad, there weren't many choices for me other than doing a platformer.

At the start of February, <a href="http://www.x-team.com" target="_blank">X-Team</a> gave me the fantastic opportunity to focus solely on the game for a month and take a first playable demoÂ to GDC14 in Los Angeles and I even got to do some cool stickers and business cards! ğŸ˜€
I did some great contacts at GDC and people seemed to really like the one level I had. Unfortunately after GDC,Â due to various reasons, I couldn't put as much as I wanted into the game soÂ the development slowed down substantially.

This brings us to today where it's the first time I'm publicly talking about my game and officially [kicking-off my freelancer position at X-Team](/restart30/). From now on I'll be working only part-time and dedicating the rest of my time to other personal projects such as Project Cuba.

Hope you stay tunedÂ and soon I'll share a bit more about the actual game!
