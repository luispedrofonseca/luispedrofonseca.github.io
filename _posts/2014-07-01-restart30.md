Hi again! As you've probably figured out by now, my name is LuÃ­s Pedro Fonseca and I'm a game developer. You can learn more about me [here](/about).

This is my third introductory blog post (I've had two other blogs in the past who died horribly from abandonment) and strangely enough it doesn't get easier. I hope to not make the same mistakes with this blog as I did before and I'm counting on you to help me outÂ keeping this blog up and running. <a href="http://www.twitter.com/lpfonseca" target="_blank">Twitter following</a> is greatly appreciated too!

The reason for me to come back to blogging is that starting todayÂ I'll be dedicating a lot more time to my own games and projects. <a href="http://www.x-team.com" target="_blank">The superheroes company I've been working for</a> the last 6 years,Â and to whom I'm infinitely grateful,Â has <a href="http://x-team.com/2014/06/a-new-chapter-a-new-ceo/" target="_blank">a new CEO</a>, as of today, and this turned out to be a great opportunity for me to take a step I've considered for a while.

I'veÂ moved to a freelancer position which meansÂ I now have the option to choose whatÂ projects I work on, but more importantly, I'm able to dedicate more time and effort toÂ my own gamesÂ and projects. This blog will be a central piece of that effort with regular posts about my progress, as well as various bits and pieces about game development and other tech subjects.

Stay tuned! ðŸ˜‰
