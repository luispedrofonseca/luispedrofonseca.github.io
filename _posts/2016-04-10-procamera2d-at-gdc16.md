This year I had the honor to be invited to be part of the biggest game development conference in the world â€” the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. The invite came from Unity and they were kind enough to offer me a kiosk, inside their gigantic mega-booth, where I could showcase my <a href="http://www.procamera2d.com" target="_blank">Unity camera plugin - ProCamera2D</a>.

I also got two Expo passes for the 3 days and I even got to attend Unity's own keynote at the Intercontinental hotel (amazing breakfast included!). ðŸ˜‹

I got to meet so many amazing people and also a few happy ProCamera2D customers! Getting emails or reviews about the plugin is one thing, but being there in person and hearing how my work helped them it's a pretty incredible experience.

Going to GDC is always super rewarding, but this year, having a booth made it even more special. Hopefully I'll be back again next year with something else to show! ;)
