## Mr. Puppet

##### Tech Stack 
* Unity
* WebSockets
* Raspberry Pi

 Mr. Puppet is an invention by Thinko Animation Studio as a method to hyper accelerate the animation production process. I collaborated with the studio for a few (very fun) months to setup the Unity interface that read the glove raw data and converted it into data interpreted by the Unity engine.
