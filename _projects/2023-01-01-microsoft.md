## Microsoft

In 2011, in partnership with Grant Skinner, we were asked by Microsoft to build the game Tankster. It was a proof-of-concept to showcase at their annual BUILD conference that was going to be included in the Windows Azure Toolkit for Social Games.

We had three primary goals when building this game:
- The game had to scale to handle several hundred thousand concurrent users.
- The architecture had to be cost effective.
- The architecture had to be flexible enough for different types of games.

We were responsible for creating the Windows Phone and iOS native versions (C# and Objective-C). A very challenging but ultimately rewarding project.
