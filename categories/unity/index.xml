      <title>Unite Los Angeles 16</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was with great pleasure and pride that I learnt that ProCamera2D got nominated to this year&amp;rsquo;s Unity Awards! The award cerimony took place in Los Angeles, on the first evening of the Unite 16 conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I didn&amp;rsquo;t win, but being a finalist was more than I ever expected. The winner was &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/53895&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Dungeon Architect&lt;/a&gt;. Congratulations to Code Respawn and all the other nominees! They were all amazing and I&amp;rsquo;m very proud to be part of this group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also took the opportunity of going to the conference to spread the word about Pro Camera 2D. I had a booth for one day and like at GDC 16, it was a blast! I got to show the plugin to a lot of visitors and also got to meet some happy customers. I even got to meet (and take a picture) of the creator and visionary behind Unity - Mr. David Helgasson!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;With the one and only &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/davidhelgason&#34;&gt;@davidhelgason&lt;/a&gt;! Super proud to hear his nice words about the plugin! :) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/unity3d?src=hash&#34;&gt;#unity3d&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/gamedev?src=hash&#34;&gt;#gamedev&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/XVO4i6PwCu&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/XVO4i6PwCu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Luís Pedro Fonseca (@lpfonseca) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/lpfonseca/status/793951852152770560&#34;&gt;November 2, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conference was at the Loews Hollywood Hotel, and while a beautiful venue in an iconic location (right in front of the Hollywood Chinese Theatre / Walk of Fame), it had a few issues. The talks were on the 5th floor and the Expo Hall was on the 3rd. This meant that attendees had to go up and down between floors and that got tiring very quickly. It also meant that some people didn&amp;rsquo;t get to visit as much of the Expo Hall / Made With Unity as they probably would like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, it was a great experience! Seeing first-hand what Unity has in store for the next few versions was exciting and I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to start exploring all the new features. You can learn more about those in this &lt;a href=&#34;https://blogs.unity3d.com/2016/11/01/unite-2016-keynote-wrap-up-news-on-graphics-platforms-vr-and-more/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Unity&amp;rsquo;s blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Unity Custom Rect Editor</title>
      <link>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/unity-custom-rect-editor/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 08 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/unity-custom-rect-editor/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the main goals of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.procamera2d.com/user-guide/rooms&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ProCamera2D&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s new extension - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.procamera2d.com/user-guide/extension-rooms/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Rooms&lt;/a&gt; - was to make it as user-friendly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each room is basically a rectangle with some extra data to allow custom transitions. To make it easy to edit the rooms the user should be able to interact with them on the scene. However, Unity does not have a built-in rectangle (Rect) editor tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gladly, Unity is very flexible and easy to extend, so I created a simple one. Here you go:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&#34;//gist.github.com/luispedrofonseca/c81c26f6a30108893387292965d524b2.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then, to use it, all you have to do in your custom editor is something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-c&#34;&gt;using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;
using UnityEditor;

public class RectExample : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Rect MyRect;
}

[CustomEditor(typeof(RectExample))]
public class RectExampleEditor : Editor
{
    void OnSceneGUI()
    {
        var rectExample = (RectExample)target;

        var rect = RectUtils.ResizeRect(
            rectExample.MyRect,
            Handles.CubeCap,
            Color.green,
            Color.yellow,
            HandleUtility.GetHandleSize(Vector3.zero) * .1f,
            .1f);

        rectExample.MyRect = rect;
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end you get something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/images/unity-custom-rect-editor/rect-editor.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of the boring default editor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/images/unity-custom-rect-editor/rect-editor-manual.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope you enjoy this little tool and feel free to improve on it!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ProCamera2D at GDC16</title>
      <link>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/procamera2d-at-gdc16/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 10 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/procamera2d-at-gdc16/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This year I had the honor to be invited to be part of the biggest game development conference in the world — the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. The invite came from Unity and they were kind enough to offer me a kiosk, inside their gigantic mega-booth, where I could showcase my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.procamera2d.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Unity camera plugin - ProCamera2D&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/images/procamera2d-at-gdc16/procamera2d-booth-gdc16.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;If you look closely you can see ProCamera2D booth sign on the right&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also got two Expo passes for the 3 days and I even got to attend Unity&amp;rsquo;s own keynote at the Intercontinental hotel (amazing breakfast included!). 😋&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/images/procamera2d-at-gdc16/unity-keynote-gdc16.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got to meet so many amazing people and also a few happy ProCamera2D customers! Getting emails or reviews about the plugin is one thing, but being there in person and hearing how my work helped them it&amp;rsquo;s a pretty incredible experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going to GDC is always super rewarding, but this year, having a booth made it even more special. Hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll be back again next year with something else to show! ;)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ProCamera2D turns 1!</title>
      <link>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/procamera2d-turns-1/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 22 Jan 2016 09:35:51 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/procamera2d-turns-1/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My first commit for ProCamera2D was almost exactly 1 year ago, on January 20th 2015. It was officially released 6 months later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/images/procamera2d-turns-1/Screenshot-2016-01-22-16.05.23.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it may sound weird to celebrate this, instead of the release date, for me it really marks a turning point. On that day I decided I was going to release my own product, no matter what, after years and years of exclusively working on clients&amp;rsquo; projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I still work on clients&amp;rsquo; projects and I thoroughly enjoy it, there&amp;rsquo;s a deeper and more meaningful connection when the success and direction of a project is 100% under your responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it was, and still is, tough having to work on ProCamera2D after a day of hard work on a client project. But the rewards that come after, more than make up for those rough days. Like for example, just this week, Klaus, a fantastic platformer game was released on PS4 and it&amp;rsquo;s using ProCamera2D!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/DfwIJEexAE0&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Knowing my plugin is helping all kinds of different projects achieve their goals makes my heart warmer. The monetary benefits are also pretty great (more on that soon) and the experience I&amp;rsquo;ve gained with Unity editor tools has surpassed all the previous years combined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My plans for ProCamera2D are still far from complete so I&amp;rsquo;m really looking forward to see how this year turns out!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Learning Unity iOS Game Development — Technical review</title>
      <link>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/learning-unity-ios-game-development-technical-review/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 23 Oct 2015 11:34:16 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/learning-unity-ios-game-development-technical-review/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I got in my mailbox &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.packtpub.com/game-development/learning-unity-ios-game-development&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;a book I technically reviewed&lt;/a&gt; for Packt. It&amp;rsquo;s a great feeling having a book with your name on it, even if not on the front page. 😀&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you&amp;rsquo;ve probably guessed, it&amp;rsquo;s about Unity and iOS publishing. Although you won&amp;rsquo;t find anything particularly new in there, it&amp;rsquo;s a nice package, has a few good examples and shouldn&amp;rsquo;t disappoint you. It&amp;rsquo;s a good gift for that game dev friend of yours who is just getting started. However, if you know your way around Unity and iOS, don&amp;rsquo;t expect to learn much from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/images/learning-unity-ios-game-development-technical-review/learning_unity_ios_reviewers.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was my first time working with a book publisher and the process was really smooth. Packt are very fast and you can tell their workflow is super optimised. I received all the chapters for reviewal on the scheduled dates and even the release date was right on what they predicted several months earlier. Coming from a gaming background where projects are so often under-estimated I really value when a release date for another project is so accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My first Unity plugin is here!</title>
      <link>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/my-first-unity-plugin-is-here/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 30 Jul 2015 12:44:13 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/my-first-unity-plugin-is-here/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi all, long time no talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past few months I&amp;rsquo;ve been incredibly busy between client work and working on my first Unity plugin. This plugin started out as a little tool that I extracted from Project Cuba, but ended up becoming a full-fledged 2D camera solution so I decided to turn it into a plugin and put it on the Asset Store.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/Rzr6tjqjV60&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It ended up taking up a lot more time than I expected due to all the work I wasn&amp;rsquo;t anticipating, mostly marketing related. I tracked everything down so maybe soon I&amp;rsquo;ll write a blog post about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, go check it out and let me know your thoughts! 😉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/42095&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ProCamera2D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Unity Workshop</title>
      <link>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/unity-workshop/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 18 Mar 2015 23:05:27 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/unity-workshop/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Past month I received an invitation to give an Unity workshop at the prestigious &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.uminho.pt/en/home_en&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;University of Minho&lt;/a&gt;, located in the beautiful city of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braga&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Braga&lt;/a&gt;. The invitation came from the extremely welcoming guys at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cesium.di.uminho.pt&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CeSIUM&lt;/a&gt;, who were organising a week of events related to computer engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gladly I got a packed room with over 60 people eager to know more about Unity! This really shows how Unity is getting into the hands of users at very early stages and how the indie scene is growing in Portugal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/images/unity-workshop/cesium.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of the 2h workshop was to build something playable that everyone, despite their level of familiarity with Unity, could follow through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ended up doing a super basic Asteroids clone that most people managed to complete. I tried to attend as many requests and questions as possible but with so many people it was a bit hard to manage. At the end of the workshop I promised to share the source-code to those who didn&amp;rsquo;t complete it, but after looking at it again, trust me, you don&amp;rsquo;t want to be learning from a game hacked together in a 2h workshop! 😁&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Create Unity mobile icons</title>
      <link>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/create-unity-mobile-icons/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2014 16:55:39 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/create-unity-mobile-icons/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you work with Unity for mobile you know the pain of creating all the required icon sizes. That&amp;rsquo;s why I created a service for OS X (sorry Windows users), that with a simple right-click on a PNG gives you the option to create and conveniently name them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/images/create-unity-mobile-icons/unity_create_mobile_icons.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just select a large PNG of your icon, right-click, and then under _Services_ you&amp;rsquo;ll find &lt;em&gt;Create Unity Mobile Icons&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To install, download &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/zip/Create-Unity-Mobile-Icons.zip&#34;&gt;this zip file&lt;/a&gt; and double-click the workflow file inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me know how this worked for you! 😉 If you liked this, please share with the links below and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com&#34;&gt;follow me on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; for more Unity tips and tricks (and a few other random bits and pieces).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Spine IK is here!</title>
      <link>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/spine-ik-is-here/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 06 Sep 2014 21:34:36 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the coolest features for &lt;a href=&#34;http://esotericsoftware.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Spine&lt;/a&gt; is finally ready for prime-time. The inverse kinematics (IK) has been in the works for a few months already but it&amp;rsquo;s now available in the editor and on a wide range of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;supported runtimes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For now, I&amp;rsquo;ve only been doing some quick tests but I already have a few ideas on how I can put this to good use on Project Cuba. Stay tuned and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/lpfonseca&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;follow me on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; for more on Project Cuba coming soon!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re working with Unity on a Mac you are unfortunately stuck to the ugly, outdated and painfully sluggish, MonoDevelop. There are some alternatives like using &lt;a href=&#34;http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/Using_Sublime_Text_as_a_script_editor&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Sublime&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/c-bundle-for-textmate-version-0-03-released-4-18.1568/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;TextMate&lt;/a&gt;, or, if you&amp;rsquo;re on feeling adventurous, you can even use Visual Studio (with the amazing &lt;a href=&#34;http://unityvs.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;UnityVS&lt;/a&gt;) from a virtual machine. However, none of these options is really convenient since you either have to give up on most benefits of a true IDE or you have to use a resource hog VM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately now there&amp;rsquo;s another option, that while it won&amp;rsquo;t allow you to completely ditch MonoDevelop, it will definitely make you spend less time with it. Let me introduce you to the amazing &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/3535&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Script Inspector&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past several weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying out the Beta of the upcoming version 3. It&amp;rsquo;s still not available to the public but &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/FlipbookGames&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Flipbookee&lt;/a&gt; was kind enough to let me try out the Beta version and I must say I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;strong&gt;VERY&lt;/strong&gt; impressed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic concept of &lt;em&gt;Script Inspector&lt;/em&gt; is to allow you to edit your scripts without ever leaving the Unity editor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/images/script-inspector-3-beta-quick-review/Script_inspector_3.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part is that on this new version, you now get &lt;strong&gt;full auto-complete, code hinting, snippets, syntax error highlighting &lt;/strong&gt;and much more! You can see what&amp;rsquo;s it all about on the product &lt;a href=&#34;http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/script-inspector-3.195218/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;forum thread&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, don&amp;rsquo;t expect this to fully replace your IDE (at least not yet) since some stuff like refactoring, debugging and a few other bits and pieces are still missing. A slight pain point for me is that since the plugin is integrated into Unity you have to rely on some not so standard key shortcuts to bypass the ones from Unity itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the truth is that since I&amp;rsquo;ve started using this plugin I have to rely a lot less on jumping into MonoDevelop (and wait several seconds for it to sync) and can I simply edit my scripts instantly. Really convenient!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Script Inspector 3 is still not available, it should be pretty soon and if you buy version 2 you&amp;rsquo;ll get the update for free! Do yourself a favour and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/3535&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;get it&lt;/a&gt; now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once it&amp;rsquo;s released I&amp;rsquo;ll probably do a more in-depth review, but for now feel free to ask any questions here on the comments section or just &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/lpfonseca&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;follow me on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Unity Plugin — TimeScale Controller (Free)</title>
      <link>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/unity-plugin-timescale-controller/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2014 16:17:23 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/unity-plugin-timescale-controller/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the key aspects of the game I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/project-cuba&#34; title=&#34;Project Cuba&#34;&gt;currently working on&lt;/a&gt; is trying to make all the animations blend nicely together. That blending is accomplished by the fantastic Spine which I vouched for in a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/unity-2d-skeletal-animation/&#34;&gt;previous blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Spine does not (yet) have a way for you to test how animations transition to each other meaning I have to rely on how it looks during gameplay. Since my game is quite fast-paced, most transitions are fractions of a second which makes it really hard to see if they&amp;rsquo;re blending perfectly or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where a simple, but incredibly useful, Unity plugin made by the talented friend &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/HRuivo89&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Hugo Ruivo&lt;/a&gt; comes into place. Behold the life-saver &lt;a href=&#34;http://hruivoportfolio.wordpress.com/2014/07/26/time-scale-controller-unity3d-editor-extension/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;TimeScale Controller&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/images/unity-plugin-timescale-controller/time_scale_controller.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does one thing only, but does it beautifully. It allows you to control the time scale during gameplay and see how everything looks like in slow-motion (or fast forward, if you&amp;rsquo;d like). It may sound simplistic and I&amp;rsquo;m sure most of you could do your own, but why reinvent the wheel especially when the wheel you got is completely FREE! 😉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this plugin is useful for you and don&amp;rsquo;t forget to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/HRuivo89&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;thank Hugo&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Unity Quick Tips — Enum Description Extension Method</title>
      <link>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/unity-quick-tips-enum-description-extension-method/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 08 Aug 2014 14:16:45 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/unity-quick-tips-enum-description-extension-method/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;While this tip is not Unity specific, it&amp;rsquo;s still very useful for all C# Unity devs out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I needed to get a name/description out of a enum. After some digging around, I found this subject is far from consensual and &lt;a href=&#34;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/424366/c-sharp-string-enums&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;there are dozens of different solutions&lt;/a&gt; to accomplish the same result. For me, by far, the simplest and cleanest way to do it is by using a cool feature in C# called extension methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extension methods enable you to &amp;ldquo;add&amp;rdquo; methods to existing types without creating a new derived type, recompiling, or otherwise modifying the original type. That&amp;rsquo;s what we&amp;rsquo;re going to do to the &lt;code&gt;Enum&lt;/code&gt; type to get the results we want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the following scenario: You need an enum with the characters in your game:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-c&#34;&gt;public enum CharactersEnum
{
	MAINCHARACTER,
	ENEMY1,
	ENEMY2,
	FINALBOSS
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However at some point, you might want to show the characters names. While &lt;code&gt;FINALBOSS&lt;/code&gt; is a perfectly fine name for a character, sometimes you might feel a little bit more creative. In that case, you could add the &lt;code&gt;Description&lt;/code&gt; parameter to your enum entries, like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-c&#34;&gt;using System.ComponentModel;

public enum CharactersEnum
{
	MAINCHARACTER,
	ENEMY1,
	ENEMY2,
	[Description(&amp;quot;Mr. Bad Guy&amp;quot;)]
	FINALBOSS
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then, all you have to do is create an extension method for the &lt;code&gt;Enum&lt;/code&gt; type that can grab that description:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-c&#34;&gt;using System;
using System.ComponentModel;

public static class EnumsHelperExtension
{
	public static string ToDescription(this Enum value)
	{
		DescriptionAttribute[] da = (DescriptionAttribute[])(value.GetType().GetField(value.ToString())).GetCustomAttributes(typeof(DescriptionAttribute), false);
		return da.Length &amp;gt; 0 ? da[0].Description : value.ToString();
	}
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Save this class in a file somewhere on your project and from now on you can simply do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-c&#34;&gt;string charName = CharactersEnum.FinalBoss.ToDescription();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All your &lt;code&gt;Enum&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rsquo;s can now have a description and in case the they don&amp;rsquo;t, it will simply return the attribute name as a simple &lt;code&gt;ToString()&lt;/code&gt; usually would.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please comment or &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/lpfonseca&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;add me on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, if you have any questions or suggestions for more quick tips!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Unity 2D Skeletal Animation</title>
      <link>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/unity-2d-skeletal-animation/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Jul 2014 16:49:14 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/unity-2d-skeletal-animation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest draws, if not the biggest, of doing my own games is the opportunity to spend as much time on a feature as I feel is needed — not something you can say about most client projects where you have the constant pressure of a strict deadline on your shoulders. While most of the time, you just have to step back and realize when you&amp;rsquo;re pushing a certain feature or detail too further, sometimes you also need to bite the bullet and re-do some of your previous work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s what happened on Project Cuba when I realized my character animations were not up to the quality level I was targeting for the game. There are several reasons for that — besides my lack of animation experience — but one of the biggest is that Unity&amp;rsquo;s 2D tools are still in its infancy and there really isn&amp;rsquo;t anything built-in to handle 2D animations. You have to rely on simple rotations, translations and scaling. And while sometimes that is enough to do proper animations, the workflow is cumbersome and far from ideal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there are some plugins on the Asset Store that will greatly improve the process and bring to the table some very interesting features. Amongst those, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.puppet2d.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Puppet2D&lt;/a&gt; and the free &lt;a href=&#34;http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/release-free-unity-sprites-and-bones-2d-skeleton-animation.219915/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Unity Sprites And Bones&lt;/a&gt;, but there&amp;rsquo;s also &lt;a href=&#34;http://echo17.com/smoothmoves.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SmoothMoves&lt;/a&gt; which seems to be pretty popular as well. While these will help you immensely in comparison to what&amp;rsquo;s provided built-in, neither of them seems to be particularly polished or a one-stop solution for all of you animation needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advantages of these plugins far exceed the disadvantages, but you&amp;rsquo;ll probably find yourself fighting against the framework for a fair share of the time spent with it. I know I did with &lt;em&gt;Puppet2D&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Unity Sprites and Bones&lt;/em&gt; but also with Mecanim itself. Don&amp;rsquo;t take me wrong, Mecanim is an incredible piece of Unity and if you&amp;rsquo;re doing 3D humanoid animations I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure there&amp;rsquo;s nothing out there that can compete with it. It makes animations transitions and blending a breeze and the editor is quite useful for those who prefer a more visual approach. However, at this stage, is still not focused and/or optimised for 2D games. It has a fairly large overhead, especially on mobile, and the API is lacking. As an example here&amp;rsquo;s what my main character setup looked like with Mecanim:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/images/unity-2d-skeletal-animation/jack_mecanim.png&#34; alt=&#34;Main Character Mecanim layout&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, it&amp;rsquo;s a bit convoluted since I have well over 20 animations for my main character, but it did the work reasonably well. However, with Mecanim once your animation logic starts getting too large, performance will suffer. There are some &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/MecanimPeformanceandOptimization.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;optimizations you can do&lt;/a&gt; to minimize the problem but that&amp;rsquo;s not the purpose of today&amp;rsquo;s post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I want to show you what I think is the state-of-the-art tool for 2D animations. Meet &lt;a href=&#34;http://esotericsoftware.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Spine&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/5RTkImAOJKM&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;With an extensive, and impressive, list of features (FFD, skinning, IK, etc), but most importantly, a standalone editor and support for over 20 runtimes it&amp;rsquo;s, in my opinion, currently the way to go in terms of 2D animations in Unity (or really any other game engine). I&amp;rsquo;m not going to give you an extensive overview of what Spine is or does since you can get that from the video and link above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to show you an example of an animation I did with &lt;em&gt;Spine&lt;/em&gt; for my &lt;em&gt;Project Cuba&lt;/em&gt; main character (Jack). Two of his most distinguishable trademarks are his pompadour hairstyle and his big donut belly. Without Spine it would be really complicated and cumbersome to get a decent animation of these elements without recurring to multiple images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/images/unity-2d-skeletal-animation/jack_belly1.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/images/unity-2d-skeletal-animation/jack_hair1.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see above, with Spine support for FFD (free-form deformation) and skinning (attaching bones to a mesh), I was able to accomplish a simplistic 3D effect on his belly and a bouncy effect on his hair. All without having to recur to multiple images stealing precious memory space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still in the process of converting all my animations to Spine but I can say that from what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I won&amp;rsquo;t regret to have taken this step. In the meantime, I&amp;rsquo;ll leave you with the almost final version of Jack&amp;rsquo;s run animation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/images/unity-2d-skeletal-animation/jack_run1.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Unity Quick Tips — Global Conditional Attributes</title>
      <link>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/unity-quick-tips-global-conditional-attributes/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 18 Jul 2014 17:56:13 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/unity-quick-tips-global-conditional-attributes/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A very useful trick you can do on your Unity projects is to setup some global conditional attributes. Let&amp;rsquo;s see how and what for in a very a simple example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First go to your &lt;strong&gt;Player Settings&lt;/strong&gt; (Edit &amp;gt; Project Settings &amp;gt; Player) and under the &lt;strong&gt;Other Settings&lt;/strong&gt; tab, type &amp;ldquo;DEBUG&amp;rdquo; on the &lt;strong&gt;Scripting Define Symbols&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/images/unity-quick-tips-global-conditional-attributes/unity_define_symbols.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can now in your scripts do something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-c&#34;&gt;[System.Diagnostics.Conditional(&amp;quot;DEBUG&amp;quot;)]
void DrawRay(Vector2 start, Vector2 dir, Color color, float duration)
{
	Debug.DrawRay(start, dir, color, duration);
}

void SomeMethod()
{
	... 
	DrawRay(rayOrigin, rayDirection, Color.red, 1f);
	...
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the conditional attribute does, in this case, is only executing the &lt;code&gt;DrawRay&lt;/code&gt; method if the &amp;ldquo;DEBUG&amp;rdquo; conditional is defined. But the good news is that the code won&amp;rsquo;t give you any warnings or errors in case it isn&amp;rsquo;t!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, no more having to comment out or removing code before making a final build. Just wrap all of your debug code with a similar approach and save yourself some headaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This simple trick can obviously be applied in many other situations and once you get the hang of it I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&amp;rsquo;ll find some very interesting uses for it. Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions for more quick tips!&lt;/p&gt;
