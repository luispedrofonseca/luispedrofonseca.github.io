      <title>Unity - Supporting Multiple Aspect Ratios</title>
      <link>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/unity-supporting-multiple-aspect-ratios/</link>

      <description>One of the biggest doubts people have when creating mobile games is how to handle the myriad of screen resolutions and aspect ratios. Just on iOS there are currently 4 different aspect ratios: 4:3, 3:2, 16:9 and 19.5:9. On Android, given the thousands of different devices, it ranges anywhere between those. Here&amp;rsquo;s how those aspect ratios compare to each other (in portrait mode):
So what&amp;rsquo;s the solution to make your game look great on these screens while avoiding black bars or stretching?</description>

      <description>For the past year, I have become more and more interested in virtual reality, especially after trying out a bunch of demos at the last Unite in LA. So much, in fact, that I have decided to go ahead and buy an HTC Vive. Being a new technology, it is still quite expensive, not only because of the price of the device itself but also because you need to have a pretty beefy PC to support it.</description>

      <description>It was with great pleasure and pride that I learnt that ProCamera2D got nominated to this year&amp;rsquo;s Unity Awards! The award cerimony took place in Los Angeles, on the first evening of the Unite 16 conference.
Unfortunately I didn&amp;rsquo;t win, but being a finalist was more than I ever expected. The winner was Dungeon Architect. Congratulations to Code Respawn and all the other nominees! They were all amazing and I&amp;rsquo;m very proud to be part of this group.</description>

      <title>Unity Custom Rect Editor</title>

      <description>One of the main goals of ProCamera2D&amp;rsquo;s new extension - Rooms - was to make it as user-friendly as possible.
Each room is basically a rectangle with some extra data to allow custom transitions. To make it easy to edit the rooms the user should be able to interact with them on the scene. However, Unity does not have a built-in rectangle (Rect) editor tool.
Gladly, Unity is very flexible and easy to extend, so I created a simple one.</description>

      <description>This year I had the honor to be invited to be part of the biggest game development conference in the world â€” the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. The invite came from Unity and they were kind enough to offer me a kiosk, inside their gigantic mega-booth, where I could showcase my Unity camera plugin - ProCamera2D.
I also got two Expo passes for the 3 days and I even got to attend Unity&amp;rsquo;s own keynote at the Intercontinental hotel (amazing breakfast included!</description>

      <title>ProCamera2D turns 1!</title>

      <description>My first commit for ProCamera2D was almost exactly 1 year ago, on January 20th 2015. It was officially released 6 monthsÂ later.
Although it may sound weird to celebrate this, instead of the release date, for me it really marks a turning point. On that day I decided I was going to release my own product, no matter what, after years and years of exclusively working on clients&amp;rsquo;Â projects.
While I still work on clients&amp;rsquo; projects and I thoroughly enjoy it, there&amp;rsquo;s a deeper and more meaningful connection when the successÂ and direction of a project is 100% under your responsibility.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I got in my mailbox a book I technically reviewed for Packt. It&amp;rsquo;s a great feeling having a book with your name on it, even if not on the front page. ðŸ˜€
As you&amp;rsquo;ve probably guessed, it&amp;rsquo;s about Unity and iOS publishing. Although you won&amp;rsquo;t find anything particularly new in there, it&amp;rsquo;s a nice package, has a few good examples and shouldn&amp;rsquo;t disappoint you. It&amp;rsquo;s a good gift for thatÂ game dev friend of yours who is just getting started.</description>

      <description>Hi all, long time no talk.
For the past few months I&amp;rsquo;ve been incredibly busy between client work andÂ working on my first Unity plugin.Â This plugin started out as a little tool that I extracted from Project Cuba, but ended up becoming a full-fledged 2D camera solution so I decided to turn it into a plugin and put it on the Asset Store.
  It ended up taking up a lot more time than I expected due to all the work I wasn&amp;rsquo;t anticipating, mostly marketing related.</description>

      <description>Past month IÂ received an invitation to give an Unity workshop at the prestigious University of Minho, located in the beautiful city of Braga. The invitation came from the extremely welcoming guys at CeSIUM, who were organising a week of events related to computer engineering.
Gladly I got a packed room with overÂ 60 people eager to know more about Unity! This really shows how Unity isÂ getting into the hands of users at very early stagesÂ and how the indie scene is growing in Portugal.</description>

      <title>Create Unity mobile icons</title>

      <description>If you work with UnityÂ for mobile you know the pain of creating all the required icon sizes. That&amp;rsquo;s why I created a service for OS X (sorry Windows users), that with a simple right-click onÂ a PNG gives you the option to create and conveniently name them.
Just select a largeÂ PNG of your icon, right-click, and then under _Services_Â you&amp;rsquo;ll find Create Unity Mobile Icons.
To install, downloadÂ this zip fileÂ and double-click the workflow file inside.</description>

      <description>One of the coolest features for Spine is finally ready for prime-time. The inverse kinematics (IK) has been in the works for a few months already but it&amp;rsquo;s now availableÂ in the editor and on a wide range of the supported runtimes.
  For now, I&amp;rsquo;ve only been doing some quick tests butÂ I already have a few ideas on how I can put this to good use on Project Cuba.</description>

      <title>Script Inspector 3 (Beta) Quick Review</title>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re working with Unity on a Mac you are unfortunately stuck to the ugly, outdated and painfullyÂ sluggish, MonoDevelop. There are some alternatives like using Sublime, TextMate, or, if you&amp;rsquo;re on feeling adventurous, you can evenÂ use Visual Studio (with the amazing UnityVS) from a virtual machine.Â However, none of these options is reallyÂ convenient since you either have to give up on most benefits ofÂ a trueÂ IDE or you have to use a resourceÂ hog VM.</description>

      <title>Unity Plugin â€” TimeScale Controller (Free)</title>
      <link>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/unity-plugin-timescale-controller/</link>

      <guid>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/unity-plugin-timescale-controller/</guid>
      <description>One of the key aspects of the game I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on is trying to makeÂ all the animations blend nicely together.Â That blending is accomplished by the fantastic Spine which I vouched for in a previous blog post.
However, Spine does not (yet) have a way for you to test how animations transition to each other meaning I have to rely on how it looks during gameplay. Since my game is quiteÂ fast-paced,Â most transitions are fractions of a second which makes it really hard to see if they&amp;rsquo;re blending perfectly or not.</description>

      <title>Unity Quick Tips â€” Enum Description Extension Method</title>

      <guid>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/unity-quick-tips-enum-description-extension-method/</guid>
      <description>While this tip is not Unity specific, it&amp;rsquo;s still very useful for all C#Â Unity devs out there.
Recently I needed to get a name/description out of a enum. After some digging around, I found this subject is far from consensual and there are dozens of different solutions to accomplish the same result. For me, by far, theÂ simplest and cleanest way to do it is by using a cool feature in C# called extension methods.</description>

      <description>One of the biggest draws, if not the biggest, of doing my own games is the opportunityÂ to spend as much time on a feature as I feel is needed â€” not something you can say aboutÂ most client projects where you have the constant pressure of a strict deadline on your shoulders. While most of the time, you just have to step back and realize when you&amp;rsquo;re pushing a certain feature or detail too further, sometimes you also need to bite the bullet and re-do some of yourÂ previous work.</description>

      <title>Unity Quick Tips â€” Global Conditional Attributes</title>

      <guid>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/unity-quick-tips-global-conditional-attributes/</guid>
      <description>A very useful trick you can do on your Unity projects is to setup some global conditional attributes. Let&amp;rsquo;s see how and what for in a very a simple example.
First go to your Player Settings (Edit &amp;gt; Project Settings &amp;gt; Player) and under the Other Settings tab, type &amp;ldquo;DEBUG&amp;rdquo; on the Scripting Define Symbols.
You can now in your scripts do something like:
[System.Diagnostics.Conditional(&amp;quot;DEBUG&amp;quot;)] void DrawRay(Vector2 start, Vector2 dir, Color color, float duration) { Debug.</description>

      <title>Unity Quick Tips â€” Local Cache Server</title>
      <link>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/unity-quick-tips-cache-server/</link>

      <guid>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/unity-quick-tips-cache-server/</guid>
      <description>After many years working with Unity, I&amp;rsquo;ve realisedÂ that oneÂ of the most overlooked features of the Unity&amp;rsquo;s Team License, by myself and other fellow developers, is the Cache Server.
Like the name says, what it basically does isÂ caching your assets in order to make them load faster. This isÂ particularly great if you&amp;rsquo;re working on a multi-platform game where you need to switch platforms constantly. As you all know, every time youÂ do that Unity has to reimport all the assets, which can be a pretty painful depending on the size and number of resources on your project.</description>
