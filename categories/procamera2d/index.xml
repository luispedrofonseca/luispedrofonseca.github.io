      <title>Unite Los Angeles 16</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was with great pleasure and pride that I learnt that ProCamera2D got nominated to this year&amp;rsquo;s Unity Awards! The award cerimony took place in Los Angeles, on the first evening of the Unite 16 conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I didn&amp;rsquo;t win, but being a finalist was more than I ever expected. The winner was &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/53895&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Dungeon Architect&lt;/a&gt;. Congratulations to Code Respawn and all the other nominees! They were all amazing and I&amp;rsquo;m very proud to be part of this group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also took the opportunity of going to the conference to spread the word about Pro Camera 2D. I had a booth for one day and like at GDC 16, it was a blast! I got to show the plugin to a lot of visitors and also got to meet some happy customers. I even got to meet (and take a picture) of the creator and visionary behind Unity - Mr. David Helgasson!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;With the one and only &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/davidhelgason&#34;&gt;@davidhelgason&lt;/a&gt;! Super proud to hear his nice words about the plugin! :) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/unity3d?src=hash&#34;&gt;#unity3d&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/gamedev?src=hash&#34;&gt;#gamedev&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/XVO4i6PwCu&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/XVO4i6PwCu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Luís Pedro Fonseca (@lpfonseca) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/lpfonseca/status/793951852152770560&#34;&gt;November 2, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conference was at the Loews Hollywood Hotel, and while a beautiful venue in an iconic location (right in front of the Hollywood Chinese Theatre / Walk of Fame), it had a few issues. The talks were on the 5th floor and the Expo Hall was on the 3rd. This meant that attendees had to go up and down between floors and that got tiring very quickly. It also meant that some people didn&amp;rsquo;t get to visit as much of the Expo Hall / Made With Unity as they probably would like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, it was a great experience! Seeing first-hand what Unity has in store for the next few versions was exciting and I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to start exploring all the new features. You can learn more about those in this &lt;a href=&#34;https://blogs.unity3d.com/2016/11/01/unite-2016-keynote-wrap-up-news-on-graphics-platforms-vr-and-more/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Unity&amp;rsquo;s blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Unity Custom Rect Editor</title>
      <link>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/unity-custom-rect-editor/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 08 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/unity-custom-rect-editor/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the main goals of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.procamera2d.com/user-guide/rooms&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ProCamera2D&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s new extension - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.procamera2d.com/user-guide/extension-rooms/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Rooms&lt;/a&gt; - was to make it as user-friendly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each room is basically a rectangle with some extra data to allow custom transitions. To make it easy to edit the rooms the user should be able to interact with them on the scene. However, Unity does not have a built-in rectangle (Rect) editor tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gladly, Unity is very flexible and easy to extend, so I created a simple one. Here you go:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&#34;//gist.github.com/luispedrofonseca/c81c26f6a30108893387292965d524b2.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then, to use it, all you have to do in your custom editor is something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-c&#34;&gt;using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;
using UnityEditor;

public class RectExample : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Rect MyRect;
}

[CustomEditor(typeof(RectExample))]
public class RectExampleEditor : Editor
{
    void OnSceneGUI()
    {
        var rectExample = (RectExample)target;

        var rect = RectUtils.ResizeRect(
            rectExample.MyRect,
            Handles.CubeCap,
            Color.green,
            Color.yellow,
            HandleUtility.GetHandleSize(Vector3.zero) * .1f,
            .1f);

        rectExample.MyRect = rect;
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end you get something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/images/unity-custom-rect-editor/rect-editor.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of the boring default editor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/images/unity-custom-rect-editor/rect-editor-manual.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope you enjoy this little tool and feel free to improve on it!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ProCamera2D at GDC16</title>
      <link>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/procamera2d-at-gdc16/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 10 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/procamera2d-at-gdc16/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This year I had the honor to be invited to be part of the biggest game development conference in the world — the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. The invite came from Unity and they were kind enough to offer me a kiosk, inside their gigantic mega-booth, where I could showcase my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.procamera2d.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Unity camera plugin - ProCamera2D&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/images/procamera2d-at-gdc16/procamera2d-booth-gdc16.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;If you look closely you can see ProCamera2D booth sign on the right&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also got two Expo passes for the 3 days and I even got to attend Unity&amp;rsquo;s own keynote at the Intercontinental hotel (amazing breakfast included!). 😋&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/images/procamera2d-at-gdc16/unity-keynote-gdc16.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got to meet so many amazing people and also a few happy ProCamera2D customers! Getting emails or reviews about the plugin is one thing, but being there in person and hearing how my work helped them it&amp;rsquo;s a pretty incredible experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going to GDC is always super rewarding, but this year, having a booth made it even more special. Hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll be back again next year with something else to show! ;)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ProCamera2D turns 1!</title>
      <link>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/procamera2d-turns-1/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 22 Jan 2016 09:35:51 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/procamera2d-turns-1/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My first commit for ProCamera2D was almost exactly 1 year ago, on January 20th 2015. It was officially released 6 months later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/images/procamera2d-turns-1/Screenshot-2016-01-22-16.05.23.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it may sound weird to celebrate this, instead of the release date, for me it really marks a turning point. On that day I decided I was going to release my own product, no matter what, after years and years of exclusively working on clients&amp;rsquo; projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I still work on clients&amp;rsquo; projects and I thoroughly enjoy it, there&amp;rsquo;s a deeper and more meaningful connection when the success and direction of a project is 100% under your responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it was, and still is, tough having to work on ProCamera2D after a day of hard work on a client project. But the rewards that come after, more than make up for those rough days. Like for example, just this week, Klaus, a fantastic platformer game was released on PS4 and it&amp;rsquo;s using ProCamera2D!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/DfwIJEexAE0&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Knowing my plugin is helping all kinds of different projects achieve their goals makes my heart warmer. The monetary benefits are also pretty great (more on that soon) and the experience I&amp;rsquo;ve gained with Unity editor tools has surpassed all the previous years combined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My plans for ProCamera2D are still far from complete so I&amp;rsquo;m really looking forward to see how this year turns out!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My first Unity plugin is here!</title>
      <link>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/my-first-unity-plugin-is-here/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 30 Jul 2015 12:44:13 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/my-first-unity-plugin-is-here/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi all, long time no talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past few months I&amp;rsquo;ve been incredibly busy between client work and working on my first Unity plugin. This plugin started out as a little tool that I extracted from Project Cuba, but ended up becoming a full-fledged 2D camera solution so I decided to turn it into a plugin and put it on the Asset Store.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/Rzr6tjqjV60&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It ended up taking up a lot more time than I expected due to all the work I wasn&amp;rsquo;t anticipating, mostly marketing related. I tracked everything down so maybe soon I&amp;rsquo;ll write a blog post about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, go check it out and let me know your thoughts! 😉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/42095&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ProCamera2D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
