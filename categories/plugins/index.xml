      <description>It was with great pleasure and pride that I learnt that ProCamera2D got nominated to this year&amp;rsquo;s Unity Awards! The award cerimony took place in Los Angeles, on the first evening of the Unite 16 conference.
Unfortunately I didn&amp;rsquo;t win, but being a finalist was more than I ever expected. The winner was Dungeon Architect. Congratulations to Code Respawn and all the other nominees! They were all amazing and I&amp;rsquo;m very proud to be part of this group.</description>

      <title>Unity Custom Rect Editor</title>

      <description>One of the main goals of ProCamera2D&amp;rsquo;s new extension - Rooms - was to make it as user-friendly as possible.
Each room is basically a rectangle with some extra data to allow custom transitions. To make it easy to edit the rooms the user should be able to interact with them on the scene. However, Unity does not have a built-in rectangle (Rect) editor tool.
Gladly, Unity is very flexible and easy to extend, so I created a simple one.</description>

      <description>This year I had the honor to be invited to be part of the biggest game development conference in the world — the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. The invite came from Unity and they were kind enough to offer me a kiosk, inside their gigantic mega-booth, where I could showcase my Unity camera plugin - ProCamera2D.
I also got two Expo passes for the 3 days and I even got to attend Unity&amp;rsquo;s own keynote at the Intercontinental hotel (amazing breakfast included!</description>

      <title>ProCamera2D turns 1!</title>

      <description>My first commit for ProCamera2D was almost exactly 1 year ago, on January 20th 2015. It was officially released 6 months later.
Although it may sound weird to celebrate this, instead of the release date, for me it really marks a turning point. On that day I decided I was going to release my own product, no matter what, after years and years of exclusively working on clients&amp;rsquo; projects.
While I still work on clients&amp;rsquo; projects and I thoroughly enjoy it, there&amp;rsquo;s a deeper and more meaningful connection when the success and direction of a project is 100% under your responsibility.</description>

      <title>My first Unity plugin is here!</title>

      <description>Hi all, long time no talk.
For the past few months I&amp;rsquo;ve been incredibly busy between client work and working on my first Unity plugin. This plugin started out as a little tool that I extracted from Project Cuba, but ended up becoming a full-fledged 2D camera solution so I decided to turn it into a plugin and put it on the Asset Store.
  It ended up taking up a lot more time than I expected due to all the work I wasn&amp;rsquo;t anticipating, mostly marketing related.</description>

      <title>Create Unity mobile icons</title>

      <description>If you work with Unity for mobile you know the pain of creating all the required icon sizes. That&amp;rsquo;s why I created a service for OS X (sorry Windows users), that with a simple right-click on a PNG gives you the option to create and conveniently name them.
Just select a large PNG of your icon, right-click, and then under _Services_ you&amp;rsquo;ll find Create Unity Mobile Icons.
To install, download this zip file and double-click the workflow file inside.</description>

      <title>Spine IK is here!</title>

      <description>One of the coolest features for Spine is finally ready for prime-time. The inverse kinematics (IK) has been in the works for a few months already but it&amp;rsquo;s now available in the editor and on a wide range of the supported runtimes.
  For now, I&amp;rsquo;ve only been doing some quick tests but I already have a few ideas on how I can put this to good use on Project Cuba.</description>

      <title>Script Inspector 3 (Beta) Quick Review</title>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re working with Unity on a Mac you are unfortunately stuck to the ugly, outdated and painfully sluggish, MonoDevelop. There are some alternatives like using Sublime, TextMate, or, if you&amp;rsquo;re on feeling adventurous, you can even use Visual Studio (with the amazing UnityVS) from a virtual machine. However, none of these options is really convenient since you either have to give up on most benefits of a true IDE or you have to use a resource hog VM.</description>

      <title>Unity Plugin — TimeScale Controller (Free)</title>
      <link>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/unity-plugin-timescale-controller/</link>

      <description>One of the key aspects of the game I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on is trying to make all the animations blend nicely together. That blending is accomplished by the fantastic Spine which I vouched for in a previous blog post.
However, Spine does not (yet) have a way for you to test how animations transition to each other meaning I have to rely on how it looks during gameplay. Since my game is quite fast-paced, most transitions are fractions of a second which makes it really hard to see if they&amp;rsquo;re blending perfectly or not.</description>

      <title>Unity 2D Skeletal Animation</title>

      <description>One of the biggest draws, if not the biggest, of doing my own games is the opportunity to spend as much time on a feature as I feel is needed — not something you can say about most client projects where you have the constant pressure of a strict deadline on your shoulders. While most of the time, you just have to step back and realize when you&amp;rsquo;re pushing a certain feature or detail too further, sometimes you also need to bite the bullet and re-do some of your previous work.</description>
