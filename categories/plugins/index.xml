      <title>Unite Los Angeles 16</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was with great pleasure and pride that I learnt that ProCamera2D got nominated to this year&amp;rsquo;s Unity Awards! The award cerimony took place in Los Angeles, on the first evening of the Unite 16 conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I didn&amp;rsquo;t win, but being a finalist was more than I ever expected. The winner was &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/53895&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Dungeon Architect&lt;/a&gt;. Congratulations to Code Respawn and all the other nominees! They were all amazing and I&amp;rsquo;m very proud to be part of this group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also took the opportunity of going to the conference to spread the word about Pro Camera 2D. I had a booth for one day and like at GDC 16, it was a blast! I got to show the plugin to a lot of visitors and also got to meet some happy customers. I even got to meet (and take a picture) of the creator and visionary behind Unity - Mr. David Helgasson!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;With the one and only &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/davidhelgason&#34;&gt;@davidhelgason&lt;/a&gt;! Super proud to hear his nice words about the plugin! :) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/unity3d?src=hash&#34;&gt;#unity3d&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/gamedev?src=hash&#34;&gt;#gamedev&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/XVO4i6PwCu&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/XVO4i6PwCu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Luís Pedro Fonseca (@lpfonseca) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/lpfonseca/status/793951852152770560&#34;&gt;November 2, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conference was at the Loews Hollywood Hotel, and while a beautiful venue in an iconic location (right in front of the Hollywood Chinese Theatre / Walk of Fame), it had a few issues. The talks were on the 5th floor and the Expo Hall was on the 3rd. This meant that attendees had to go up and down between floors and that got tiring very quickly. It also meant that some people didn&amp;rsquo;t get to visit as much of the Expo Hall / Made With Unity as they probably would like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, it was a great experience! Seeing first-hand what Unity has in store for the next few versions was exciting and I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to start exploring all the new features. You can learn more about those in this &lt;a href=&#34;https://blogs.unity3d.com/2016/11/01/unite-2016-keynote-wrap-up-news-on-graphics-platforms-vr-and-more/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Unity&amp;rsquo;s blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Unity Custom Rect Editor</title>
      <link>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/unity-custom-rect-editor/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 08 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/unity-custom-rect-editor/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the main goals of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.procamera2d.com/user-guide/rooms&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ProCamera2D&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s new extension - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.procamera2d.com/user-guide/extension-rooms/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Rooms&lt;/a&gt; - was to make it as user-friendly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each room is basically a rectangle with some extra data to allow custom transitions. To make it easy to edit the rooms the user should be able to interact with them on the scene. However, Unity does not have a built-in rectangle (Rect) editor tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gladly, Unity is very flexible and easy to extend, so I created a simple one. Here you go:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&#34;//gist.github.com/luispedrofonseca/c81c26f6a30108893387292965d524b2.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then, to use it, all you have to do in your custom editor is something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-c&#34;&gt;using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;
using UnityEditor;

public class RectExample : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Rect MyRect;
}

[CustomEditor(typeof(RectExample))]
public class RectExampleEditor : Editor
{
    void OnSceneGUI()
    {
        var rectExample = (RectExample)target;

        var rect = RectUtils.ResizeRect(
            rectExample.MyRect,
            Handles.CubeCap,
            Color.green,
            Color.yellow,
            HandleUtility.GetHandleSize(Vector3.zero) * .1f,
            .1f);

        rectExample.MyRect = rect;
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end you get something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/images/unity-custom-rect-editor/rect-editor.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of the boring default editor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/images/unity-custom-rect-editor/rect-editor-manual.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope you enjoy this little tool and feel free to improve on it!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ProCamera2D at GDC16</title>
      <link>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/procamera2d-at-gdc16/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 10 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/procamera2d-at-gdc16/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This year I had the honor to be invited to be part of the biggest game development conference in the world — the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. The invite came from Unity and they were kind enough to offer me a kiosk, inside their gigantic mega-booth, where I could showcase my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.procamera2d.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Unity camera plugin - ProCamera2D&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/images/procamera2d-at-gdc16/procamera2d-booth-gdc16.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;If you look closely you can see ProCamera2D booth sign on the right&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also got two Expo passes for the 3 days and I even got to attend Unity&amp;rsquo;s own keynote at the Intercontinental hotel (amazing breakfast included!). 😋&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/images/procamera2d-at-gdc16/unity-keynote-gdc16.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got to meet so many amazing people and also a few happy ProCamera2D customers! Getting emails or reviews about the plugin is one thing, but being there in person and hearing how my work helped them it&amp;rsquo;s a pretty incredible experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going to GDC is always super rewarding, but this year, having a booth made it even more special. Hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll be back again next year with something else to show! ;)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ProCamera2D turns 1!</title>
      <link>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/procamera2d-turns-1/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 22 Jan 2016 09:35:51 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/procamera2d-turns-1/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My first commit for ProCamera2D was almost exactly 1 year ago, on January 20th 2015. It was officially released 6 months later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/images/procamera2d-turns-1/Screenshot-2016-01-22-16.05.23.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it may sound weird to celebrate this, instead of the release date, for me it really marks a turning point. On that day I decided I was going to release my own product, no matter what, after years and years of exclusively working on clients&amp;rsquo; projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I still work on clients&amp;rsquo; projects and I thoroughly enjoy it, there&amp;rsquo;s a deeper and more meaningful connection when the success and direction of a project is 100% under your responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it was, and still is, tough having to work on ProCamera2D after a day of hard work on a client project. But the rewards that come after, more than make up for those rough days. Like for example, just this week, Klaus, a fantastic platformer game was released on PS4 and it&amp;rsquo;s using ProCamera2D!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/DfwIJEexAE0&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Knowing my plugin is helping all kinds of different projects achieve their goals makes my heart warmer. The monetary benefits are also pretty great (more on that soon) and the experience I&amp;rsquo;ve gained with Unity editor tools has surpassed all the previous years combined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My plans for ProCamera2D are still far from complete so I&amp;rsquo;m really looking forward to see how this year turns out!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My first Unity plugin is here!</title>
      <link>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/my-first-unity-plugin-is-here/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 30 Jul 2015 12:44:13 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/my-first-unity-plugin-is-here/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi all, long time no talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past few months I&amp;rsquo;ve been incredibly busy between client work and working on my first Unity plugin. This plugin started out as a little tool that I extracted from Project Cuba, but ended up becoming a full-fledged 2D camera solution so I decided to turn it into a plugin and put it on the Asset Store.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/Rzr6tjqjV60&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It ended up taking up a lot more time than I expected due to all the work I wasn&amp;rsquo;t anticipating, mostly marketing related. I tracked everything down so maybe soon I&amp;rsquo;ll write a blog post about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, go check it out and let me know your thoughts! 😉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/42095&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ProCamera2D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Create Unity mobile icons</title>
      <link>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/create-unity-mobile-icons/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2014 16:55:39 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/create-unity-mobile-icons/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you work with Unity for mobile you know the pain of creating all the required icon sizes. That&amp;rsquo;s why I created a service for OS X (sorry Windows users), that with a simple right-click on a PNG gives you the option to create and conveniently name them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/images/create-unity-mobile-icons/unity_create_mobile_icons.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just select a large PNG of your icon, right-click, and then under _Services_ you&amp;rsquo;ll find &lt;em&gt;Create Unity Mobile Icons&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To install, download &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/zip/Create-Unity-Mobile-Icons.zip&#34;&gt;this zip file&lt;/a&gt; and double-click the workflow file inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me know how this worked for you! 😉 If you liked this, please share with the links below and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com&#34;&gt;follow me on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; for more Unity tips and tricks (and a few other random bits and pieces).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Spine IK is here!</title>
      <link>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/spine-ik-is-here/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 06 Sep 2014 21:34:36 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the coolest features for &lt;a href=&#34;http://esotericsoftware.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Spine&lt;/a&gt; is finally ready for prime-time. The inverse kinematics (IK) has been in the works for a few months already but it&amp;rsquo;s now available in the editor and on a wide range of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;supported runtimes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;

 &lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For now, I&amp;rsquo;ve only been doing some quick tests but I already have a few ideas on how I can put this to good use on Project Cuba. Stay tuned and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/lpfonseca&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;follow me on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; for more on Project Cuba coming soon!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Script Inspector 3 (Beta) Quick Review</title>
      <link>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/script-inspector-3-beta-quick-review/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2014 18:12:54 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/script-inspector-3-beta-quick-review/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re working with Unity on a Mac you are unfortunately stuck to the ugly, outdated and painfully sluggish, MonoDevelop. There are some alternatives like using &lt;a href=&#34;http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/Using_Sublime_Text_as_a_script_editor&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Sublime&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/c-bundle-for-textmate-version-0-03-released-4-18.1568/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;TextMate&lt;/a&gt;, or, if you&amp;rsquo;re on feeling adventurous, you can even use Visual Studio (with the amazing &lt;a href=&#34;http://unityvs.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;UnityVS&lt;/a&gt;) from a virtual machine. However, none of these options is really convenient since you either have to give up on most benefits of a true IDE or you have to use a resource hog VM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately now there&amp;rsquo;s another option, that while it won&amp;rsquo;t allow you to completely ditch MonoDevelop, it will definitely make you spend less time with it. Let me introduce you to the amazing &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/3535&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Script Inspector&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past several weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying out the Beta of the upcoming version 3. It&amp;rsquo;s still not available to the public but &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/FlipbookGames&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Flipbookee&lt;/a&gt; was kind enough to let me try out the Beta version and I must say I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;strong&gt;VERY&lt;/strong&gt; impressed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic concept of &lt;em&gt;Script Inspector&lt;/em&gt; is to allow you to edit your scripts without ever leaving the Unity editor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/images/script-inspector-3-beta-quick-review/Script_inspector_3.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part is that on this new version, you now get &lt;strong&gt;full auto-complete, code hinting, snippets, syntax error highlighting &lt;/strong&gt;and much more! You can see what&amp;rsquo;s it all about on the product &lt;a href=&#34;http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/script-inspector-3.195218/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;forum thread&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, don&amp;rsquo;t expect this to fully replace your IDE (at least not yet) since some stuff like refactoring, debugging and a few other bits and pieces are still missing. A slight pain point for me is that since the plugin is integrated into Unity you have to rely on some not so standard key shortcuts to bypass the ones from Unity itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the truth is that since I&amp;rsquo;ve started using this plugin I have to rely a lot less on jumping into MonoDevelop (and wait several seconds for it to sync) and can I simply edit my scripts instantly. Really convenient!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Script Inspector 3 is still not available, it should be pretty soon and if you buy version 2 you&amp;rsquo;ll get the update for free! Do yourself a favour and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/3535&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;get it&lt;/a&gt; now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once it&amp;rsquo;s released I&amp;rsquo;ll probably do a more in-depth review, but for now feel free to ask any questions here on the comments section or just &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/lpfonseca&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;follow me on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Unity Plugin — TimeScale Controller (Free)</title>
      <link>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/unity-plugin-timescale-controller/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the key aspects of the game I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/project-cuba&#34; title=&#34;Project Cuba&#34;&gt;currently working on&lt;/a&gt; is trying to make all the animations blend nicely together. That blending is accomplished by the fantastic Spine which I vouched for in a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/unity-2d-skeletal-animation/&#34;&gt;previous blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Spine does not (yet) have a way for you to test how animations transition to each other meaning I have to rely on how it looks during gameplay. Since my game is quite fast-paced, most transitions are fractions of a second which makes it really hard to see if they&amp;rsquo;re blending perfectly or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where a simple, but incredibly useful, Unity plugin made by the talented friend &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/HRuivo89&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Hugo Ruivo&lt;/a&gt; comes into place. Behold the life-saver &lt;a href=&#34;http://hruivoportfolio.wordpress.com/2014/07/26/time-scale-controller-unity3d-editor-extension/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;TimeScale Controller&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/images/unity-plugin-timescale-controller/time_scale_controller.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does one thing only, but does it beautifully. It allows you to control the time scale during gameplay and see how everything looks like in slow-motion (or fast forward, if you&amp;rsquo;d like). It may sound simplistic and I&amp;rsquo;m sure most of you could do your own, but why reinvent the wheel especially when the wheel you got is completely FREE! 😉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this plugin is useful for you and don&amp;rsquo;t forget to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/HRuivo89&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;thank Hugo&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Unity 2D Skeletal Animation</title>
      <link>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/unity-2d-skeletal-animation/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Jul 2014 16:49:14 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/unity-2d-skeletal-animation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest draws, if not the biggest, of doing my own games is the opportunity to spend as much time on a feature as I feel is needed — not something you can say about most client projects where you have the constant pressure of a strict deadline on your shoulders. While most of the time, you just have to step back and realize when you&amp;rsquo;re pushing a certain feature or detail too further, sometimes you also need to bite the bullet and re-do some of your previous work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s what happened on Project Cuba when I realized my character animations were not up to the quality level I was targeting for the game. There are several reasons for that — besides my lack of animation experience — but one of the biggest is that Unity&amp;rsquo;s 2D tools are still in its infancy and there really isn&amp;rsquo;t anything built-in to handle 2D animations. You have to rely on simple rotations, translations and scaling. And while sometimes that is enough to do proper animations, the workflow is cumbersome and far from ideal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there are some plugins on the Asset Store that will greatly improve the process and bring to the table some very interesting features. Amongst those, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.puppet2d.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Puppet2D&lt;/a&gt; and the free &lt;a href=&#34;http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/release-free-unity-sprites-and-bones-2d-skeleton-animation.219915/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Unity Sprites And Bones&lt;/a&gt;, but there&amp;rsquo;s also &lt;a href=&#34;http://echo17.com/smoothmoves.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SmoothMoves&lt;/a&gt; which seems to be pretty popular as well. While these will help you immensely in comparison to what&amp;rsquo;s provided built-in, neither of them seems to be particularly polished or a one-stop solution for all of you animation needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advantages of these plugins far exceed the disadvantages, but you&amp;rsquo;ll probably find yourself fighting against the framework for a fair share of the time spent with it. I know I did with &lt;em&gt;Puppet2D&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Unity Sprites and Bones&lt;/em&gt; but also with Mecanim itself. Don&amp;rsquo;t take me wrong, Mecanim is an incredible piece of Unity and if you&amp;rsquo;re doing 3D humanoid animations I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure there&amp;rsquo;s nothing out there that can compete with it. It makes animations transitions and blending a breeze and the editor is quite useful for those who prefer a more visual approach. However, at this stage, is still not focused and/or optimised for 2D games. It has a fairly large overhead, especially on mobile, and the API is lacking. As an example here&amp;rsquo;s what my main character setup looked like with Mecanim:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/images/unity-2d-skeletal-animation/jack_mecanim.png&#34; alt=&#34;Main Character Mecanim layout&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, it&amp;rsquo;s a bit convoluted since I have well over 20 animations for my main character, but it did the work reasonably well. However, with Mecanim once your animation logic starts getting too large, performance will suffer. There are some &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/MecanimPeformanceandOptimization.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;optimizations you can do&lt;/a&gt; to minimize the problem but that&amp;rsquo;s not the purpose of today&amp;rsquo;s post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I want to show you what I think is the state-of-the-art tool for 2D animations. Meet &lt;a href=&#34;http://esotericsoftware.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Spine&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/5RTkImAOJKM&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;With an extensive, and impressive, list of features (FFD, skinning, IK, etc), but most importantly, a standalone editor and support for over 20 runtimes it&amp;rsquo;s, in my opinion, currently the way to go in terms of 2D animations in Unity (or really any other game engine). I&amp;rsquo;m not going to give you an extensive overview of what Spine is or does since you can get that from the video and link above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to show you an example of an animation I did with &lt;em&gt;Spine&lt;/em&gt; for my &lt;em&gt;Project Cuba&lt;/em&gt; main character (Jack). Two of his most distinguishable trademarks are his pompadour hairstyle and his big donut belly. Without Spine it would be really complicated and cumbersome to get a decent animation of these elements without recurring to multiple images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/images/unity-2d-skeletal-animation/jack_belly1.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/images/unity-2d-skeletal-animation/jack_hair1.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see above, with Spine support for FFD (free-form deformation) and skinning (attaching bones to a mesh), I was able to accomplish a simplistic 3D effect on his belly and a bouncy effect on his hair. All without having to recur to multiple images stealing precious memory space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still in the process of converting all my animations to Spine but I can say that from what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I won&amp;rsquo;t regret to have taken this step. In the meantime, I&amp;rsquo;ll leave you with the almost final version of Jack&amp;rsquo;s run animation.&lt;/p&gt;
