      <description>A month ago I wrote about why I wasn&amp;rsquo;t renewing my Adobe subscription. At that time, I was planning to replace Photoshop and Illustrator with Pixelmator and iDraw, respectively. One month later, everything still stands, but those like me, who have been considering a change for a long time, now have one more VERY strong reason to do so.
A couple of weeks ago, while on vacation, I was checking my Twitter feed and someone shared a video about a new software that just got released on the App Store.</description>

      <title>Project Cuba Main Character progress</title>

      <description>Recently I was digging through some of my files and found the various iterations of Jack, the main character of my upcoming game, Project Cuba.
While the process itself was fairly simple and quick I think it&amp;rsquo;s worth to share because it shows a different approach of the typical process. Since my hand drawing skills are very limited I opted to jump straight into Illustrator. While this is probably a lot slower for someone that knows how to put their thoughts in paper and only then trace them.</description>

      <title>Project Cuba First Audio Test</title>

      <description>While at this point I&amp;rsquo;d like to be showing you some Project Cuba gameplay, the truth is that progress on that regard has been slower than expected. I&amp;rsquo;ve been super busy with some client projects and when I do have some time, there&amp;rsquo;s still plenty to do before my perfectionist self puts some gameplay out there. But please don&amp;rsquo;t despair, it&amp;rsquo;s coming soon! 😁
However, this week I&amp;rsquo;m bringing you the first musical piece for the game.</description>

      <title>Spine IK is here!</title>

      <description>One of the coolest features for Spineis finally ready for prime-time. The inverse kinematics (IK) has been in the works for a few months already but it&amp;rsquo;s now available in the editor and on a wide range of the supported runtimes.
For now, I&amp;rsquo;ve only been doing some quick tests but I already have a few ideas on how I can put this to good use on Project Cuba. Stay tuned and follow me on Twitterfor more on Project Cuba coming soon!</description>

      <title>Unity Plugin — TimeScale Controller (Free)</title>
      <link>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/unity-plugin-timescale-controller/</link>

      <description>One of the key aspects of the game I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on is trying to make all the animations blend nicely together. That blending is accomplished by the fantastic Spine which I vouched for in a previous blog post.
However, Spine does not (yet) have a way for you to test how animations transition to each other meaning I have to rely on how it looks during gameplay. Since my game is quite fast-paced, most transitions are fractions of a second which makes it really hard to see if they&amp;rsquo;re blending perfectly or not.</description>

      <title>Unity 2D Skeletal Animation</title>

      <description>One of the biggest draws, if not the biggest, of doing my own games is the opportunity to spend as much time on a feature as I feel is needed — not something you can say about most client projects where you have the constant pressure of a strict deadline on your shoulders. While most of the time, you just have to step back and realize when you&amp;rsquo;re pushing a certain feature or detail too further, sometimes you also need to bite the bullet and re-do some of your previous work.</description>

      <title>Going public</title>

      <description>For the last several months, during my (very limited) free time, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a game which started to form in my head ever since I visited the incredibly beautiful city of Havana, Cuba in October 2012.
I got enchanted by everything about it but especially its old charm - from the colourful 19th-century buildings to the imported american cars, the incredible white sand beaches and the overall good vibe of the cuban locals.</description>
