      <description>&lt;p&gt;The nice guys at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.creativebloq.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CreativeBloq&lt;/a&gt; contacted me to do an interview regarding my creative process, more specifically about how I used Affinity Designer on Project Cuba to speed up my development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a look &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.creativebloq.com/how-design-game-character&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and let me know your thoughts! 😉&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New tool — New character!</title>
      <link>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/new-tool-new-character/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2014 17:25:15 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/new-tool-new-character/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A month ago I wrote about why &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/thank-you-adobe/&#34;&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t renewing my Adobe subscription&lt;/a&gt;. At that time, I was planning to replace Photoshop and Illustrator with Pixelmator and iDraw, respectively. One month later, everything still stands, but those like me, who have been considering a change for a long time, now have one more VERY strong reason to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago, while on vacation, I was checking my Twitter feed and someone shared a video about a new software that just got released on the App Store. At that time I thought I knew pretty much all alternatives to Adobe software out there. However, apparently the biggest contender to this &amp;ldquo;war&amp;rdquo; was hiding in the shadows ready to attack! Don&amp;rsquo;t take me wrong, Pixelmator and iDraw are both pretty cool but this one is in a totally new league of its own!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m talking about Affinity Designer, by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.serif.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Serif&lt;/a&gt;. An UK company that I honestly haven&amp;rsquo;t heard of before but that I&amp;rsquo;m sure that will change from now on! Here&amp;rsquo;s an overview of Affinity Designer&amp;rsquo;s main features.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/FTxPeheWO64&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Once I saw this video, I knew I had to try this. So I did and here&amp;rsquo;s the result of it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/images/new-tool-new-character/jacqueline1.png&#34; alt=&#34;Jacqueline, Jack&#39;s wife&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look closely, you&amp;rsquo;ll notice that all my characters for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/project-cuba/&#34;&gt;Project Cuba&lt;/a&gt; have this style of flat colours with one shadow and one highlight per piece. While the technique in itself is pretty simple, achieving it in Illustrator / iDraw is not so much. However, in Affinity Designer, you can mask a shape by simply making it a child of another one!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a simple detail allowed me to make this character in MUCH less time than I would in any other software. Since then I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Affinity for the last couple of days and I keep finding small details like this that make working on it a huge pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;rsquo;t decided already after sawing that presentation video, let me tell you, do yourself a favor and &lt;a href=&#34;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/affinity-designer/id824171161?mt=12&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;go get it&lt;/a&gt;!!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Project Cuba Main Character progress</title>
      <link>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/project-cuba-main-character-progress/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 21 Sep 2014 21:45:09 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/project-cuba-main-character-progress/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I was digging through some of my files and found the various iterations of Jack, the main character of my upcoming game, Project Cuba.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the process itself was fairly simple and quick I think it&amp;rsquo;s worth to share because it shows a different approach of the typical process. Since my hand drawing skills are very limited I opted to jump straight into Illustrator. While this is probably a lot slower for someone that knows how to put their thoughts in paper and only then trace them. For me, it allows to slowly progress into what I have in my head and at the same time it gives me flexibility to make bold changes and not worrying about ruining it. In fact, most of the time is by doing bold changes (or mistakes) that you end up finding that cool detail you were not initially planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, here&amp;rsquo;s the final result. Hope you like and let me know your thoughts! 😉&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Project Cuba First Audio Test</title>
      <link>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/project-cuba-first-audio-test/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 13 Sep 2014 15:02:25 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While at this point I&amp;rsquo;d like to be showing you some Project Cuba gameplay, the truth is that progress on that regard has been slower than expected. I&amp;rsquo;ve been super busy with some client projects and when I do have some time, there&amp;rsquo;s still plenty to do before my perfectionist self puts some gameplay out there.  But please don&amp;rsquo;t despair, it&amp;rsquo;s coming soon! 😁&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this week I&amp;rsquo;m bringing you the first musical piece for the game. My super talented friend, Sérgio Ferreira, will be taking the lead on the audio side and this week he sent me the first test for one of the main themes. I honestly think it&amp;rsquo;s amazing and he definitely captured exactly the mood I want to bring for the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without further ado, please download and let me know your thoughts! 😉&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the coolest features for &lt;a href=&#34;http://esotericsoftware.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Spine&lt;/a&gt; is finally ready for prime-time. The inverse kinematics (IK) has been in the works for a few months already but it&amp;rsquo;s now available in the editor and on a wide range of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;supported runtimes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/orqb4Hz4rqI&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For now, I&amp;rsquo;ve only been doing some quick tests but I already have a few ideas on how I can put this to good use on Project Cuba. Stay tuned and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/lpfonseca&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;follow me on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; for more on Project Cuba coming soon!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Unity Plugin — TimeScale Controller (Free)</title>
      <link>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/unity-plugin-timescale-controller/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2014 16:17:23 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/unity-plugin-timescale-controller/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the key aspects of the game I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/project-cuba&#34; title=&#34;Project Cuba&#34;&gt;currently working on&lt;/a&gt; is trying to make all the animations blend nicely together. That blending is accomplished by the fantastic Spine which I vouched for in a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/unity-2d-skeletal-animation/&#34;&gt;previous blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Spine does not (yet) have a way for you to test how animations transition to each other meaning I have to rely on how it looks during gameplay. Since my game is quite fast-paced, most transitions are fractions of a second which makes it really hard to see if they&amp;rsquo;re blending perfectly or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where a simple, but incredibly useful, Unity plugin made by the talented friend &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/HRuivo89&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Hugo Ruivo&lt;/a&gt; comes into place. Behold the life-saver &lt;a href=&#34;http://hruivoportfolio.wordpress.com/2014/07/26/time-scale-controller-unity3d-editor-extension/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;TimeScale Controller&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/images/unity-plugin-timescale-controller/time_scale_controller.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does one thing only, but does it beautifully. It allows you to control the time scale during gameplay and see how everything looks like in slow-motion (or fast forward, if you&amp;rsquo;d like). It may sound simplistic and I&amp;rsquo;m sure most of you could do your own, but why reinvent the wheel especially when the wheel you got is completely FREE! 😉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this plugin is useful for you and don&amp;rsquo;t forget to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/HRuivo89&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;thank Hugo&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Unity 2D Skeletal Animation</title>
      <link>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/unity-2d-skeletal-animation/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Jul 2014 16:49:14 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/unity-2d-skeletal-animation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest draws, if not the biggest, of doing my own games is the opportunity to spend as much time on a feature as I feel is needed — not something you can say about most client projects where you have the constant pressure of a strict deadline on your shoulders. While most of the time, you just have to step back and realize when you&amp;rsquo;re pushing a certain feature or detail too further, sometimes you also need to bite the bullet and re-do some of your previous work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s what happened on Project Cuba when I realized my character animations were not up to the quality level I was targeting for the game. There are several reasons for that — besides my lack of animation experience — but one of the biggest is that Unity&amp;rsquo;s 2D tools are still in its infancy and there really isn&amp;rsquo;t anything built-in to handle 2D animations. You have to rely on simple rotations, translations and scaling. And while sometimes that is enough to do proper animations, the workflow is cumbersome and far from ideal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there are some plugins on the Asset Store that will greatly improve the process and bring to the table some very interesting features. Amongst those, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.puppet2d.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Puppet2D&lt;/a&gt; and the free &lt;a href=&#34;http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/release-free-unity-sprites-and-bones-2d-skeleton-animation.219915/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Unity Sprites And Bones&lt;/a&gt;, but there&amp;rsquo;s also &lt;a href=&#34;http://echo17.com/smoothmoves.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SmoothMoves&lt;/a&gt; which seems to be pretty popular as well. While these will help you immensely in comparison to what&amp;rsquo;s provided built-in, neither of them seems to be particularly polished or a one-stop solution for all of you animation needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advantages of these plugins far exceed the disadvantages, but you&amp;rsquo;ll probably find yourself fighting against the framework for a fair share of the time spent with it. I know I did with &lt;em&gt;Puppet2D&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Unity Sprites and Bones&lt;/em&gt; but also with Mecanim itself. Don&amp;rsquo;t take me wrong, Mecanim is an incredible piece of Unity and if you&amp;rsquo;re doing 3D humanoid animations I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure there&amp;rsquo;s nothing out there that can compete with it. It makes animations transitions and blending a breeze and the editor is quite useful for those who prefer a more visual approach. However, at this stage, is still not focused and/or optimised for 2D games. It has a fairly large overhead, especially on mobile, and the API is lacking. As an example here&amp;rsquo;s what my main character setup looked like with Mecanim:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/images/unity-2d-skeletal-animation/jack_mecanim.png&#34; alt=&#34;Main Character Mecanim layout&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, it&amp;rsquo;s a bit convoluted since I have well over 20 animations for my main character, but it did the work reasonably well. However, with Mecanim once your animation logic starts getting too large, performance will suffer. There are some &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/MecanimPeformanceandOptimization.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;optimizations you can do&lt;/a&gt; to minimize the problem but that&amp;rsquo;s not the purpose of today&amp;rsquo;s post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I want to show you what I think is the state-of-the-art tool for 2D animations. Meet &lt;a href=&#34;http://esotericsoftware.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Spine&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/5RTkImAOJKM&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;With an extensive, and impressive, list of features (FFD, skinning, IK, etc), but most importantly, a standalone editor and support for over 20 runtimes it&amp;rsquo;s, in my opinion, currently the way to go in terms of 2D animations in Unity (or really any other game engine). I&amp;rsquo;m not going to give you an extensive overview of what Spine is or does since you can get that from the video and link above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to show you an example of an animation I did with &lt;em&gt;Spine&lt;/em&gt; for my &lt;em&gt;Project Cuba&lt;/em&gt; main character (Jack). Two of his most distinguishable trademarks are his pompadour hairstyle and his big donut belly. Without Spine it would be really complicated and cumbersome to get a decent animation of these elements without recurring to multiple images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/images/unity-2d-skeletal-animation/jack_belly1.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/images/unity-2d-skeletal-animation/jack_hair1.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see above, with Spine support for FFD (free-form deformation) and skinning (attaching bones to a mesh), I was able to accomplish a simplistic 3D effect on his belly and a bouncy effect on his hair. All without having to recur to multiple images stealing precious memory space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still in the process of converting all my animations to Spine but I can say that from what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I won&amp;rsquo;t regret to have taken this step. In the meantime, I&amp;rsquo;ll leave you with the almost final version of Jack&amp;rsquo;s run animation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/images/unity-2d-skeletal-animation/jack_run1.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Going public</title>
      <link>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/going-public/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2014 22:53:11 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/going-public/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the last several months, during my (very limited) free time, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working  on a game which started to form in my head ever since I visited the incredibly beautiful city of Havana, Cuba in October 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/images/going-public/havana.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got enchanted by everything about it but especially its old charm - from the colourful 19th-century buildings to the imported american cars, the incredible white sand beaches and the overall good vibe of the cuban locals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that point I was already prototyping a top-down stealth game, and I then knew it had to be about Cuba. Given the stealth mechanics of my prototype I wanted to come up with a spy/conspiracy story that fitted right into the cuban theme and its whole retro atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/images/going-public/ProjectCuba_early_proto.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Very early version of the stealth prototype&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between me and my girlfriend (thank you!) we came up with various crazy concepts but in the end we settled for a fictional story around the relatively famous &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_missile_crisis&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Cuban missile crisis&lt;/a&gt;. To add a bit of humour into the mix we came up with a retired american cop taken right out of a Miami Vice episode. I uninspiredly called the game Project Cuba - and here are the main characters (more about them in an upcoming post):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/images/going-public/ProjectCuba_characters.png&#34; alt=&#34;Jack - The good guy&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; General Fernando - The bad guy&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; Soldier - The basic enemy guy&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout 2013 I worked on this stealth prototype on and off (mostly off) and unfortunately only around Christmas I decided that it didn&amp;rsquo;t have what it needed to be a fun game and finally dropped it. However, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t just loose all the work I&amp;rsquo;d done so I decided to reuse the story, the characters and even some of the previous mechanics on my next project. I started working a new prototype on January 1st 2014 and after spending most of Christmas vacations playing Rayman Legends on my iPad, there weren&amp;rsquo;t many choices for me other than doing a platformer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/images/going-public/project_cuba_gdc.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;GDC demo and promo material&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start of February, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.x-team.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;X-Team&lt;/a&gt; gave me the fantastic opportunity to focus solely on the game for a month and take a first playable demo to GDC14 in Los Angeles and I even got to do some cool stickers and business cards! 😀
I did some great contacts at GDC and people seemed to really like the one level I had. Unfortunately after GDC, due to various reasons, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t put as much as I wanted into the game so the development slowed down substantially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brings us to today where it&amp;rsquo;s the first time I&amp;rsquo;m publicly talking about my game and officially &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.luispedrofonseca.com/restart30/&#34;&gt;kicking-off my freelancer position at X-Team&lt;/a&gt;. From now on I&amp;rsquo;ll be working only part-time and dedicating the rest of my time to other personal projects such as Project Cuba.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope you stay tuned and soon I&amp;rsquo;ll share a bit more about the actual game!&lt;/p&gt;
